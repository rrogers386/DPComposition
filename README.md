# DPComposition
This repo provides the code to generate plots that compare bounded range DP composition with the general optimal DP composition.  See this paper, accepted as a Spotlight Presentation at NeurIPS 2019, for more details: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04273.pdf

To generate the plots, simply run the code in compare_comps.py (where the functions it uses are in the optimal_comp.py file.  You can uncomment a line in compare_comps.py to save the figure as a pdf.  Further, you can switch between different eps_per parameters in the curves that are plotted.
